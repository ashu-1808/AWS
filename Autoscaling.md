# **AutoScaling**

Autoscaling automatically adds or removes EC2 instances based on demand so your application stays available, performant and cost efficient.


Autoscaling monitors and automatically adjusts the capacity to maintain steady performance at the lowest price.

AWS autoscaling monitors application and scales AWS server automatically.

Autoscaling is region specific.

Autoscaling enables elasticity by scaling horizontally by adding or termination of an instance.
