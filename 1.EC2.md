# EC2 [Elastic Compute Cloud]
```
-Amazon EC2 is a foundational service within the compute domain of AWS
-It falls under IaaS
-Using ec2 we can create virtual machine
(virtualmachine / Instance / VM / server)
-EC2 is a region specific service
-You can create 20 instances per region
```
## Steps to Create EC2 Instance (AWS)
```
1. Login to AWS Management Console.
2. Go to EC2 Dashboard
3. Click Launch Instance
4. Enter Instance Name
5. Select AMI (Operating System).
6. Choose Instance Type (CPU & RAM).
7. Select or Create Key Pair:
Used for secure instance login.
 types:
   public Key – Stored in AWS.
   Private Key – Downloaded by use.
8. Configure Security Group (Allow SSH/HTTP/HTTPS).
9. Configure Storage (HDD/SSD size).
10. Click Launch Instance.

→ EC2 instance created successfully ✅

```
## Types of instance state:
```
Stop – Shuts down instance.
Start – Powers on instance.
Reboot – Restarts instance.
Hibernate – Stops and saves RAM state.
Terminate – Deletes instance permanently.
Running – Instance is active.
Pending – Instance is launching.
```
## Check status:
```
- Detect the problem that may appear
- Status check are basically Health checks
- 2/2 = all okay
- 1/2 = system is clear but instance not okay
  → To resolve this please reboot instance
- 0/2 = system and instance both are not okay
  → To resolve this please stop then restart instance
```
## Every instance has 2 ip address Public and private
```
A. Public IP Address
 -Used to communicate over the internet.
 -Assigned automatically when instance starts.
 -Changes after stop/start (dynamic).

B. Private IP Address
 -Used for communication within the same network (VPC).
 -Assigned inside the private network.
 -Remains same after stop/start (static).
```
## Security group :
```
While working on it you only work on Inbound Rule
1.Inbound rule → Incoming traffic
2.Outbound rule → outgoing traffic

Default setting :
Inbound rule : No Rule
Outbound rule : Traffic allowed
Source Type :
You cannot block anyone but you can customize or add IP address which can access
 1.Anywhere : Everyone
 2.Custom : Can customize who can access
 3.My IP : Only owner
```

## SSH (Secure Shell)
 ```
 -Network communication protocol used to connect EC2 instance remotely.
 -Used because communication between host and client is encrypted.
 -Provides secure command-line access.
 -Works on Port 22 (Linux).
 -Security group changes apply immediately.
```
## Steps to Connect Linux EC2 Instance (SSH)
```
 1.Launch a Linux EC2 instance.
 2.Select the instance and click Connect.
 3.Choose the SSH Client option.
 4.Open Terminal (Git Bash / CMD / Linux terminal).
 5.Go to the folder where the .pem key is downloaded.
 6.Set permission: chmod 400 key.pem (for Linux/Mac).
 7.Copy the SSH command provided by AWS.
 8.Run the SSH command in terminal.
 9.Type yes (first time only).
```
## RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol)
 ```
 -Protocol that allows user to remotely access and control another computer.
 - Mainly used to connect to Windows servers.
 - Provides graphical desktop access.
 - Works on Port 3389 (Windows).
```
## Steps to Connect Windows EC2 Instance (RDP)
 ```
1.Launch a Windows EC2 instance.
 2.Select the instance and click Connect.
 3.Choose the RDP Client option.
 4.Download the Remote Desktop (.rdp) file.
 5.Click Get Password.
 6.Upload your private key (.pem) file.
 7.Decrypt the password and copy it.
 8.Open the downloaded .rdp file.
 9.Click Connect and enter the password.
 10.Click Yes to trust the certificate.

" Windows instance connected successfully ✅"
```
## While creating webserver you need to add http/https web-server
```
A.HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)
1.Works on Port 80.
2.Used to transfer data between browser and server.
3.Data is not encrypted.
4.Less secure for communication.
5.URL starts with http://.

B.HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure)
1.Works on Port 443.
2.Secure version of HTTP.
3.Data is encrypted using SSL/TLS.
4.Provides secure communication between client and server.
5.URL starts with https://.
```

## Package management
```
-For downloading package you need to install package management tool
-Package management tool is software that helps you install, update, remove and manage
 software packages automatically on a operating system
-With systemctl you can start, stop, restart, check status and perform other advanced
 action on services
1.Yum : [Yellowdog Updater Modifier]
 → debian, ubuntu, mint, kali linux
2.apt : [Advanced Packaged Tool]
 → Red Hat Enterprise Linux [RHEL], CentOS
3.dnf : [Dandified YUM] faster replacement for yum.
 → Fedora, RHEL8+, centOS 8+
```

 - Best for short-term workloads.

B) Spot Instance
 - Up to 90% cheaper than On-Demand.
 - Can be terminated anytime if spot price increases.
 - Cost-efficient option in AWS.
 - Best for fault-tolerant workloads (testing, data analysis, image processing).
 - Not suitable for critical jobs.

C) Reserved Instance (RI)
  -Up to 75% cheaper than On-Demand.
  - 1-year or 3-year commitment.
  -Payment Options:
    1. Zero Upfront – No initial payment.
    2. Partial Upfront – Some payment initially.
    3. Full Upfront – Full payment in advance.

D) Dedicated Host

  - Most expensive option.

E) Savings Plans
  - Up to 75% discount compared to On-Demand.
  - Commitment for 1 or 3 years (e.g., $5/hour usage).
  - Locked to specific instance family & region (e.g., t2 in ap-east-1).
  - Flexible across instance sizes (t2.nano, t2.medium).
  - Flexible across OS (Linux, Windows, RedHat).
