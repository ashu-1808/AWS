```
Amazon CloudWatch:
 - AWS CloudWatch is monitoring and observing service from AWS that helps you to
 collect, track, visualize and act on metrics, logs and events across AWS resources
 or application.
 - It monitors resources such as:
   1. EC2 (CPU, Disk, Network)
   2. ELB (Request count, latency)
   3. RDS
   4. Lambda (Invocations, errors)
```
### CloudWatch Concepts
```
 1. Dashboard :
   - Customizable homepage in cloudwatch console that you can use to monitor your resources
     in a single view even those spread across the different region
   - All dashboard are global not region specific
   - There is no limit on number of cloudwatch you can create
   - They give real time view & are shareable
   - You can add, remove, resize, move, edit or rename a graph & can create metrics manually
     in graph
```
```
  2. Namespace :
    - It is a container of cloudwatch metrics
    - There is no default namespace, custom app can create custom namespace, AWS uses
     predefined namespaces
```
```
  3. Alarms
    - It watches a single metric for a specific time period, and perform one or more specified       action based on the value of the metric relative to a threshold overtime.
    - Alarms involves actions for sustained state changes only.
    - Alarm States:
      a. OK
        - Metric is within the defined threshold
        - When system is healthy, no action needed. Alarm condition is not met
        - Eg:
            CPU utilization = 35%
            Threshold = 70%
             → Alarm state is OK
      b. Alarm
        - Metric has breached the threshold for specific evaluation
        - When problem is detected it sends SNS notification, trigger autoscaling, stop or
         terminate instance
        - Eg:
           CPU utilization = 80% (3 times)
           Threshold = 70%
            → Alarm state = Alarm
     c. Insufficient Data
        - Cloudwatch does not have enough data to confirm state
        - When metric reporting is stopped, instance stopped or terminated then no alarm                 action triggers (default temporary state)
        - Eg:
          Your EC2 instance is stopped then no CPU metric is generated,
           then alarm state is Insufficient data.
```
```
  4. Metrics :
   - Metrics are time-ordered numerical data points collected over time
   - Exist only in region they are collected, stored by default for 15 months
   - Metrics are automatically generated by AWS services

### Basic Monitoring vs Detailed Monitoring

| Feature              | Basic Monitoring | Detailed Monitoring |
| -------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------- |
| Metric Frequency     | 5 minute         | 1 minute            |
| Cost                 | Free             | Paid                |
| Enable by default    | Yes              | No                  |
| Detection speed      | Limited          | Better              |
| Autoscaling Accuracy | Slow             | Fast                |
| Ideal for            | dev/test         | Production          |
