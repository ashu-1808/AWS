# RDS (Relational Database Service)
```
RDS:
   RDS is a fully managed relational database service from Amazon that makes it easy to           setup, operate and scale relational databases in the cloud.

What is meant by data?
  → Data is collection of raw facts, figures, symbols or observations.

Database?
  → Database is a systematic collection of data.
    Eg: (MT204006)
        MT → M.Tech
        20 → 2020 year
        40 → CSE department
        06 → Roll no.

DBMS?
   → Database Management System is a software that allows you to create, define, manipulate         and manage database.
 Types of DBMS
    1. Hierarchical DBMS → Tree structure
    2. Network DBMS → Graph structure
    3. Relational DBMS → Tables (Rows and Columns)
    4. Object oriented DBMS → Objects & Classes

RDBMS (Relational Database Management System)
     → It is a software or applications that manages and controls data stored in tabular form.

Table
     →Table is a collection of related data in organized manner in the form of rows and               columns.
   - Tables are related to each others
   - All fields must be filled
   - Data is filled in the form of rows & columns
   - A row of table is also called record/tuple
   - It contains specific information of each individual entry in the table
   - Column of table is also called attribute/field
   - Each table has its own primary key
   - A schema is used to strictly define table columns, index and relation between tables
   - Best suitable for online transaction process (OLTP)
   - Cannot scale out horizontally because tables are related to each other
   - But we can scale out vertically
   - Famous RDBMS: MySQL, Oracle, MariaDB, IBM-DB2
```

## RDBMS vs NoSQL

| Feature     | RDBMS                     | NoSQL                     |
| ----------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Query lang  | SQL                       | API                       |
| Consistency | Strong (ACID)             | BASE                      |
| Best for    | Complex queries data      | High volume / Low latency |
| Use case    | Banking / ERP / Reporting | Big data / Real time apps |
| Complexity  | Structured & strict       | Flexible / schema-less    |
| Scalability | Vertical (Scale up)       | Horizontal (Scale out)    |
| Schema      | Fixed (Pre-defined)       | Flexible                  |
| Data model  | Table (Rows & Columns)    | Document, Column, Graph   |

## AWS RDS:

```
- AWS provides Relational Database Service
- AWS RDS is a fully managed AWS service
- It is fully responsible for DB
   1. Automated group
   2. Security group
   3. Software updates for DB
   4. AWS provides Disaster recovery
   5. By default, every DB has weekly maintenance window of (1–35 days) can be created               manually.

- There are some settings managed by users:
    1. Managed DB instances
    2. Creation of relational database schema or design of database

- There are 8 Relational Database options on AWS:
    1. Aurora (MySQL – compatible)
    2. Aurora (PostgreSQL – compatible)
    3. MySQL
    4. PostgreSQL
    5. Maria DB
    6. Oracle Database
    7. Microsoft SQL Server
    8. IBM DB2
```
 
## Steps for RDS
```
1. Select Standard create
2. Choose Engine option and its version
3. Give (Database name (console-name)
   Master username admin & master-password
4. Choose Storage
5. Choose Availability and durability
   (Gives option to create standby instance)
6. Connectivity
 i. Choose if you want to connect it to EC2 or not
 ii. Check network type
 iii. Choose VPC or get default
 iv. Public access or not
 v. VPC security group → RDS-security (if not there then create it)
 vi.(Additional configuration)
    a. Give database name (Real-database-name) → DB-1
    b. Backup option or Backup replication
    c. Maintenance option
7. Go to RDS Security Group & Edit Inbound Rules
     Add: 1. MySQL/Aurora → Anywhere → Port: 3306
          2. SSH → Anywhere → 22
          3. HTTP → Anywhere → 80
          4. HTTPS → Anywhere → 443
          5. Custom TCP → Anywhere → 8080
8. Connect Ubuntu Instance
   → sudo -i
   → apt install mysql-client -y
   → mysql -h <endpoint of database> -u admin -p
   → Enter password
   → mysql> create database student_db;
   → mysql> exit

 9. Backend Setup
   → git clone https://github.com/shubhamkalgat/cloudblitz-student-app.git
   → cd cloudblitz-student-app
   → cd backend
   → apt install openjdk-17-jdk -y
   → java --version
   → apt install maven -y
   → mvn --version
   → mvn clean
10. To connect backend to frontend
   → vim src/main/resources/application.properties
    - Press `i` → To enter insert mode
    - (Edit localhost with endpoint of database)
      spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mariadb://<database-endpoint>:3306/student_db
      spring.datasource.username = admin
      spring.datasource.password = abcd1234

     - press **Esc** then press `:wq`
         to save & exit

11. Build:
   → mvn clean package

    (It will build code)
    ...... (Build success)
      
13. Install NodeJS:
   → apt install nodejs npm -y
   → npm install 
     (Node package manager)

14. To connect frontend to backend:
   → vim .env
     ( Change URL with instance public URL)
   - Example:(http://49.503.504.31:8080/api)

   - press `esc` then `:wq` to save & exit
   → npm run build


15. Install Apache Webserver
   → apt install apache2 -y

16. Copy whole dist folder in web server
   →  cp -rf dist/* /var/www/html/

17. Start Apache
   → systemctl start apache2
   → systemctl enable apache2
   → cd ..
   → cd backend
   → cd target
   → java -jar (file in red colour)
   (e.g. java -jar student-registration-backend-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar)

 - open public URL of instance in browser
 - Add entries
 - keep the old instance running
 - open the same instance on different windows

   → sudo -i
   → mysql -h (Endpoint of Database) -u admin -p
     - Enter password
     - show databases;
     - use student_db;
     - show tables;
     - select * from users;
```

```
While doing this:
 - We need to install java's updated version, because while installing apt may install the        previous version.
 - We install maven → It helps to build code.

```
