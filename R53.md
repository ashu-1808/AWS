```
- R → Routing
- 53 → It works on Port No 53**
- Route 53** is a highly available & scalable DNS (Domain Name System) web service from AWS.
- Domain is used to convert domain name to IP address.
- How can use Route 53?
   1. Transfer existing domain
   2. Register new domain
   3. Route traffic for domain
   4. Perform health check for your resources
- Route 53 is a global service
- Types of TLD
  1. Generic Level Domain
  2. Geographic Level Domain / Country code domain
  Example:
  ```

```
In AWS there are two top level domain :
  1. Generic level domain: .com, .org, .net, .edu
  2.Geographical level domain: .in, .us, .cn

Steps to configure Route-53 :
  1. First you need to register a domain
     (It can be on R53 or another DNS register)
  2. Create a hosted zone on route53 then it can be done automatically.
     If you register your domain from route53, otherwise you have to create hosted zone manually.
  3. Inside the hosted zone you need to create record set.


Hosted zone :
 - Hosted zone is a container of records
 - Records contain info for how you want to route traffic for specific domain.
   eg: ediblitz.edmingte.com/v3/myaccount
 - Types of Hosted zone
   1. Public Hosted zone:
     It contains how you want to route the traffic on internet
   2. Private Hosted zone:
     It contains records that specifies how you want to route traffic to VPC

- For each public hosted zonethat you create on Amazon-R53 automatically creates:
  1.Name Server(NS) Records:
  2.Start Of Authority(SOA) Records:
- Always remember 4 NS record will be created
- SOA record is nothing but details of your domain
- NS records is responsible for resolving your domain


Records: Record tells DNS where to route the traffic for a domain or subdomain
 Record types :
  1) A Record :
    → Maps a domain name to an IPv4 address
      eg: google.com → 8.8.8.8
  2) AAAA Record :
    → Maps a domain name to an IPv6 address
  3) CNAME Record :
    → Maps one domain name to another domain name
     [www.google.com](http://www.google.com) → google.com
  4) MX Records :
    → Routes emails to server
      example.com → mail.example.com
  5) TXT Records :
    → Stores text information. Used for domain verification
    → Improves email security
  6) NS Records :
    → Specifies authoritative DNS server
    → Automatically created for Hosted zones
  7) SOA Records (Start of Authority) :
    → Contains administrative information of Domain
    → Automatically created by Route53
  8) Alias Record (AWS specific) :
    → AWS extension to DNS
    → Points a domain to ELB, CloudFront, API Gateway, S3 website.

Health check available = ✓
Health check not available = ✗
